    The FCC has gutted net neutrality, opening the door for big cable companies to create Internet "fast lanes," censor content, and throttle traffic ... and they've already begun doing so.  **Tell your lawmakers: "Please protect our online freedom by voting for legislation that will return Title II net neutrality protections.**

  title: Calling you now...
  body_html: |
    **Introduce yourself, be polite and say:**

    I'm calling to ask my lawmakers to reject proposals from Representatives Latta, McMorris Rodgers and Walden that will weaken net neutrality. I want real net neutrality protections, NOT laws written by cable company lobbyists. Thank you.
  warning: If lines are busy, we may call you in a few minutes.
